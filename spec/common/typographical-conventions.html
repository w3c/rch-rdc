  <dt><code>markup</code></dt><dd>
    Markup (elements, attributes, properties),

    property names,
    and file names are in red-orange monospace font.</dd>
  <dt><var>variable</var></dt><dd>
    A variable in pseudo-code or in an algorithm description is italicized.</dd>
  <dt><dfn data-no-xref="">definition</dfn></dt><dd>

    is italicized and in bold.</dd>
  <dt><a data-lt="definition">definition reference</a></dt><dd>
    A reference to a definition <em>in this document</em>
    is underlined and is also an active link to the definition itself. </dd>
  <dt><a data-lt="definition"><code>markup definition reference</code></a></dt><dd>
    References to a definition <em>in this document</em>,
    when the reference itself is also a markup, is underlined,
    in a red-orange monospace font, and is also an active link to the definition itself.</dd>
  <dt><a class="externalDFN">external definition reference</a></dt><dd>
    A reference to a definition <em>in another document</em>
    is underlined and italicized, and is also an active link to the definition itself.</dd>
  <dt><a class="externalDFN"><code> markup external definition reference</code></a></dt><dd>
    A reference to a definition <em>in another document</em>,
    when the reference itself is also a markup,
    is underlined and italicized in a red-orange monospace font,
    and is also an active link to the definition itself.</dd>
  <dt><a href="">hyperlink</a></dt><dd>
    A hyperlink is underlined and in blue.</dd>
  <dt>[<a href="">reference</a>]</dt><dd>
    A document reference (normative or informative) is enclosed in square brackets
    and links to the references section.</dd>
  <dt><span class="details"><span class="summary">Explanation</span></span></dt><dd>
    An expandable area to find a more detailed, non-normative explanation of a
    particular algorithmic step.
    <details>
      <summary>Explanation</summary>
      <p>This area would provide more information about the step involved.</p>
    </details>
  </dd>
  <dt><span class="details"><span class="summary">Logging</span></span></dt><dd>
    An expandable area to find suggestions for implementations to log
    information about processing,
    which may be useful in comparing with other implementations,
    or with logs provided with each test case.
    <details>
      <summary>Logging</summary>
      <p>For example, the following output snippet might
        describe the operation of an implementation using the [[?YAML]] format.</p>
      <pre class="logging yaml" data-transform="updateExample">
        <!--
        ca:
          ca2:
            bn_to_quads:

                - _:e0 <http://example.com/#p1> _:e1 .
              e1:

<p class="note">Notes are in light green boxes with a green left border and with a "Note" header in green.
  Notes are always informative.</p>

<pre class="example nohighlight">
  Examples are in light khaki boxes, with khaki left border,
  and with a numbered "Example" header in khaki.
  Examples are always informative. The content of the example is in monospace font and may be 
  syntax colored.

  Examples may have tabbed navigation buttons
  to show the results of transforming an example into other representations.

  Code examples are generally given in a Turtle or TriG format for brevity,
  where each line represents a single triple or quad.
  Additionally, have the following implied directives:
  
  BASE &lt;http://example.com/>
  PREFIX : &lt;#>

  Following the Turtle/TriG syntax rules, blank nodes always appear in the 
  `_:xyz` format.
