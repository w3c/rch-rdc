## General instructions for running the RDF Dataset Canonicalization Test suites
FIXME

## Contributing Tests
The test manifests and entries are built automatically from
[manifest.csv](manifest.csv) using [mk_manifest.rb](mk_manifest.rb),
where each row defines a combination of Validation tests for the same
_action_ and implicit files.
Tests may be contributed via pull request to
[https://github.com/w3c/rdf-canon](https://github.com/w3c/rdf-canon)
with suitable changes to the
[manifest.csv](manifest.csv) and necessary _action_ and _result_ files.
